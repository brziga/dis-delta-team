git - not obligatory
git lfs install

sudo:
sudo apt-get install python3-pyaudio
sudo apt install espeak

pip:
pip install ultralytics
pip install pyttsx3
pip install speechrecognition
pip install tensorflow
pip install pyzbar

should be already installed:
pip install opencv-python 

if you want to run anomaly detection notebooks, make sure you have
pip install opencv-contrib-python
and you dont have opencv-python installed (or you manually fixed which one takes priority)

not necessary for running the implementation (i think):
pip install scikit-learn
pip install matplotlib
